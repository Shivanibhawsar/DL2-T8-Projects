The dataset contains IMDb's extensive database updated till 2020. The size of the dataset is around 1.44 GB.

## Prerequisites
OS
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Pandas
Numpy

## Steps
* Firstly, you will need to download/upload the dataset to the colab and extract it in a folder
* copy the path of that folder and paste it into the PATH
* Run "project-strangecues.ipynb" on google colab
* It will take time to run
* One thing that should be noted is that the starting year of the data we used is 1960s.
* Now, you can see the top 1% moves in the dataframe named "Classic"

## Result
* We saw that the ratio of the top 1% movies with total movies is 0.0100026877229
